									<strong><u>Discussion 1: Initial</u></strong>
									<p>Schwab (2016) states that the fourth industrial revolution builds on the third, characterised by a fusion of technologies merging previously independent sectors such as digital, 
                    physical and biological. The reasoning given that society is entering industry 4.0 is due to the velocity of current breakthroughs, 
                    the scope being so widespread across every industry and the impact these breakthroughs are having on existing systems implemented in these industries.</p>

									<p>The evolution of the industrial revolution into what it is today can create challenges and opportunities for different sectors and industries. I work for an engineering company and 
                    some examples of the positive impact on this industry are as follows:

									<ul>
										<li>Additive Manufacturing – This helps with the design and manufacturing of system components, giving more freedom with design, reducing costs of manufacture, 
                      improvement in quality and reduction in production time (wizata, N.D.)</li>
										<li>Simulation – Realistic situations can be recreated to test ideas and solutions before production takes place, saving time on testing and minimising revisions of designs to get results.</li>
									</ul>

									While there are many benefits to industry 4.0, the velocity of breakthroughs and increasing demand can put a strain on companies that are struggling to adapt and are using older systems, 
                  this can lead to information system failures.</p>

                  <p>At the beginning of 2023, a fault in the Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) system caused the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to halt all air travel on commercial flight across the US. 
                    NOTAM is a centralised database that provides key safety information for nationwide air travel in the US (Gold, 2023). 
                    A projected 43,000 total passengers had been affected by the outage which was traced to a damaged database file. It was noted at the time that the FAA had struggled to update systems and processes 
                    to keep up with increasing demand, with some systems being decades old (The New York Times, 2023).</p>

                  <strong><u>Discussion 1: Summary</u></strong>

                  <p>Schwab (2016) states we have entered Industry 4.0 due the velocity, scope and impact of the current technological breakthroughs. 
                    The velocity of these breakthroughs are impacting nearly every industry today and while it brings about various benefits, some businesses are struggling to adapt to the pace of change. </p>

                  <p>As mentioned in the initial post, an example of this is the system failure of NOTAM in early 2023 caused by a damaged database file. 
                    This caused massive disruptions to flights nationwide in the US and affected a projected 43,000 passengers (The New York Times, 2023). 
                    There are some measures businesses can take to prevent such Information system failures. </p>

                  <p>In a Peer Review to my Initial post, Nima Osman suggested predictive maintenance as well as real time data monitoring as a way to prevent a situation like that of NOTAM in the future. 
                    Some other measures that can be taken by businesses are:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Regular system updates</li>
                      <li>Network Segmentation</li>
                      <li>Employee training and Awareness</li>
                      <li>Security Monitoring</li>
                    </ul>
                  Another big one that could have been useful for the NOTAM incident would have been having a comprehensive backup and recovery plan, helping to revert the system to a stable state (SentinelOne, 2024).</p>

                  <p>I currently work for a Cryogenic Engineering company which makes Ultra Low Temperature systems, these systems used to be primarily used for Research purposes however are gradually being 
                    needed for industrial and commercial use. The big use for these systems currently is the development of Quantum Computers, which need to be operated at extremely low temperatures. </p>

                  <p>Quantum computing applies to industry 4.0 as it can be used in multiple industries to optimize data analytics and performance of existing infrastructure. 
                    It also can utilize Machine Learning to analyze processes to increase yields in manufacturing environments (Aslam-Pervez, 2023).</p>
