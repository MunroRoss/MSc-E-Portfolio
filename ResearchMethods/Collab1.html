										<h1>Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</h1>
									</header>
									<strong><u>Discussion 1: Initial</u></strong>
									<p>The ACM code of ethics and professional conduct is a guide for computing professionals on their ethical conduct and how it affects the public good (ACM, 2018). </p>

									<p>In the ACM case study “Accessibility in Software Development”, a situation is explored where a new version release of a web-based tool implements a change in design pattern of a feature that included hidden controls. 
										This design pattern ultimately does not meet accessibility requirements but was still released (Horton, N, D.).</p>

                  							<p>The feature change affected blind and mobility impaired users, as well as people with cognitive disabilities as it relied on the user being able to point and click. 
										This is a clear example of how the company did not uphold sections 1.2 avoid harm and 1.4 be fair and take action not to discriminate.</p>

									<p>The accessibility issue was caught during QA testing, which is an example of the company evaluating their computer systems and their impacts; however, leadership pushed for the product to be released with the new feature meaning that public good was not the central concern for them and that they were not encouraging members of the organisation to fulfil social responsibilities.</p>

									<p>While some of the code's principles were not met, the product owner communicated the non-conformance in the accessibility conformance report and took other actions to communicate this and support affected users. 
										This indicates honesty and trustworthiness, as well as considerations for affected users, it also shows the company took actions not to withhold information on the performance of their product which aligns with code 3.e. of the BCS code of conduct (BCS, 2022).</p>

									<p>The push by leadership to release the product despite it being flagged as having accessibility issues risked damage to the company’s reputation, customer retention and risk of legal action. The company should implement more robust processes and values on their responsibility to the public and customer interest.</p>

                  							<strong><u>Discussion 1: Summary</u></strong>

                  							<p>The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and equivalent Code of Conduct for BCS Members, both outline guidance for computing professionals on their ethical conduct and responsibilities to the public interest (ACM, 2018; BCS, 2022).</p>

									<p>The design pattern implemented in the case study mentioned in my initial post was aimed at greater convenience and less clutter for the user, however the result was that the new feature had significant accessibility issues as it involved hidden controls (Horton, N, D.). 
										Fjeld et al. (2020) states that “all people deserve access to the benefits of AI technology, and that systems should be designed to facilitate that broad access”, this statement can apply to all accessibility issues with regards to technologies.</p>

									<p>While the accessibility issue was caught during the internal quality assurance testing, company leadership pushed for the product to be released despite the risks, clearly violating sections 3.1 and 3.2 of the ACM code of ethics and section 1 of the BCS code of conduct which relate to public interest and the fulfilment of social responsibilities.</p>

									<p>Details of non-conformance to accessibility standards was communicated via the company’s Accessibility Conformance Report and with the release of the product, customer service also established an accessibility webpage to support the affected users. 
										These actions showed some conformance by the employee’s and company to sections 2.2 and 2.5 of the ACM code showing that the impact and possible risks were evaluated.</p>

									<p>While there are examples of the company complying with the codes of conduct mentioned as well as not abiding by their principles, the evidence suggests a lack of concern for accessibility requirements. 
										In technology and software development, version control and rollback capabilities can help manage risk and meet compliance standards (Meegle, 2025). The original aim of the feature was to improve convenience for users and reduce clutter in the design, due to the lack of accessibility consideration it could be argues that it made the product more inconvenient.</p>
